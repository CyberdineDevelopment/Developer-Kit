# HttpConnection Implementation - Merge and Fix Coordination

## Project Context
- **Working Directory**: C:\development\fractaldataworks\Developer-Kit-httpconnection
- **Current Branch**: httpconnection-implementation
- **Target**: Merge from develop and fix all build/test issues
- **Started**: 2025-08-21

## Critical Sequence Plan

### Phase 1: Git Operations ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ git fetch origin develop 
2. ✅ git merge develop (no conflicts - clean merge)
3. ✅ Stage untracked files appropriately (committed before merge)

### Phase 2: Restore and Build Fix ✅ COMPLETED
4. ✅ dotnet restore entire solution (completed successfully)
5. ✅ Fix package version conflicts (converted Services project to use ProjectReference for EnhancedEnums)
6. ✅ Copy xunit.runner.json to test projects (using global configuration - no action needed)

### Phase 3: Validation ✅ COMPLETED
7. ✅ Verify HttpConnection service builds cleanly (builds with zero errors/warnings)
8. ✅ Test Enhanced Enums integration (proper EnumOption/EnumCollection usage confirmed)

## Quality Standards
- ✅ Zero warnings/errors in final build
- ✅ All test projects must have proper xunit configuration
- ✅ HttpConnection must integrate properly with Enhanced Enums
- ✅ Follow all FractalDataWorks service patterns

## Agent Assignments
- **dotnet-build-runner**: Restore/build operations and structured error analysis
- **services-specialist**: Validate HttpConnection follows FractalDataWorks patterns
- **file-finder**: Locate specific files (xunit configs, etc.)
- **task-manager**: Overall coordination

## Issues Discovered

### Package Version Conflicts
**Issue**: FractalDataWorks.EnhancedEnums version mismatch
- Local project exists with version 0.3.1-alpha (from version.json)
- Messages project requires EnhancedEnums >= 1.0.0 (from merge)
- Version 1.0.0 doesn't exist in package feeds
- Mix of project references vs package references causing conflicts

**Resolution Strategy**: Ensure consistent use of local project references throughout solution
**Resolution Applied**: ✅ Converted Services project from PackageReference to ProjectReference for EnhancedEnums

### Messages Project Configuration Issues  
**Issue**: Duplicate ProjectReference entries and missing project properties
**Resolution Applied**: ✅ Cleaned up project file, removed duplicates, added proper properties

## Progress Log
- **2025-08-21 Start**: Beginning git operations phase
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Git operations completed - clean merge from develop
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Package conflicts resolved, restore successful  
- **Phase 3**: ✅ HttpConnection builds cleanly, Enhanced Enums integration verified

## Final Status: ✅ SUCCESS
All critical sequence tasks completed successfully. HttpConnection implementation is ready for development.
