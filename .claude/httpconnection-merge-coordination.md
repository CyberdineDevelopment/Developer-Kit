# HttpConnection Implementation - Merge and Fix Coordination

## Project Context
- **Working Directory**: C:\development\fractaldataworks\Developer-Kit-httpconnection
- **Current Branch**: httpconnection-implementation
- **Target**: Merge from develop and fix all build/test issues
- **Started**: 2025-08-21

## Critical Sequence Plan

### Phase 1: Git Operations ✅ IN PROGRESS
1. [ ] git fetch origin develop 
2. [ ] git merge develop (handle any merge conflicts that arise)
3. [ ] Stage untracked files appropriately

### Phase 2: Restore and Build Fix
4. [ ] dotnet restore entire solution
5. [ ] Fix NETSDK1004 package restore errors (investigate and resolve package reference issues)
6. [ ] Copy xunit.runner.json to test projects (locate existing runner config and ensure test projects have it)

### Phase 3: Validation
7. [ ] Verify HttpConnection service builds cleanly (no warnings/errors)
8. [ ] Test Enhanced Enums integration (ensure the service works with framework patterns)

## Quality Standards
- ✅ Zero warnings/errors in final build
- ✅ All test projects must have proper xunit configuration
- ✅ HttpConnection must integrate properly with Enhanced Enums
- ✅ Follow all FractalDataWorks service patterns

## Agent Assignments
- **dotnet-build-runner**: Restore/build operations and structured error analysis
- **services-specialist**: Validate HttpConnection follows FractalDataWorks patterns
- **file-finder**: Locate specific files (xunit configs, etc.)
- **task-manager**: Overall coordination

## Issues Discovered
(To be updated as work progresses)
