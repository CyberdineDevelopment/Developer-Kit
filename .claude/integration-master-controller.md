1. **Developer-Kit-secretmanager** - STARTING
2. **Developer-Kit-httpconnection** - PENDING  
3. **Developer-Kit-authentication** - PENDING

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
### Main Workspace (Developer-Kit)

### Sub-Task-Manager Assignment: DEVELOP-SYNC-MANAGER
- **Target**: Sync develop branch into secretmanager workspace
- **Operations Required**:
  1. Commit/stash changes in main workspace develop branch
  2. Switch to secretmanager workspace
  3. Fetch latest develop from origin
  4. Merge develop into secretmanager-implementation branch
  5. Resolve any conflicts
  6. Build and test with zero warnings verification
  7. Fix any integration issues

### Prerequisites

- Secretmanager workspace is already clean

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS CHECKLIST
- [ ] Zero warnings at each step
- [ ] Proper git conflict resolution
- [ ] Build verification after each merge
- [ ] Test verification after each merge
- [ ] Clean integration success before proceeding
